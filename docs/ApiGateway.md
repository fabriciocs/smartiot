# SPEC-009: ApiGateway

## Background

The ApiGateway is designed to manage routing, security, and load balancing for the microservices within the Water Resource Management System. It serves as a single entry point for clients, providing centralized authentication and authorization, routing requests to appropriate microservices, and ensuring efficient communication between services.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Routing**

   - Route incoming requests to appropriate microservices.
   - Handle dynamic routing based on service discovery.

2. **Security**

   - Implement centralized authentication and authorization using JWT.
   - Ensure secure communication between clients and microservices.

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Distribute incoming requests evenly across microservice instances.
   - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle a large volume of requests efficiently.

2. **Integration**
   - Integrate seamlessly with all microservices.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Gateway, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Security, Spring Cloud Netflix (Eureka for service discovery), Spring Cloud Gateway.

### API Endpoints

- **Authentication Endpoints:**

  - `POST /authenticate` - Authenticate a user and return a JWT.

- **Routing Endpoints:**
  - Dynamic routing to all other microservices based on the request.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the security and routing settings.

2. **Develop Gateway Logic:**

   - Implement routing, authentication, and load balancing logic.

3. **Integrate Microservices:**

   - Ensure integration with all other microservices.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Gateway Logic Development:** Implement routing, authentication, and load balancing logic.
3. **Microservice Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
4. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**

   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
