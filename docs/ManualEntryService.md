# SPEC-007: ManualEntryService

## Background

The ManualEntryService is designed to allow manual entry of data within the Water Resource Management System. This ensures data reliability and provides a fallback mechanism for data collection. The service integrates seamlessly with other system components such as MeasurementService.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Manual Data Entry**
   - Allow manual data entry for various types of data.
   - Validate and process manually entered data.
   - Ensure data consistency with other services.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle a large volume of manual entries efficiently.

2. **Security**

   - Ensure data privacy and protection.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

3. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with MeasurementService and other relevant services.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud.

**Component Diagram:**
\```plantuml
@startuml
package "ManualEntryService" {
[ManualEntryController] --> [ManualEntryService]
[ManualEntryService] --> [ManualEntryRepository]
[ManualEntryService] --> [MeasurementService]
}
@enduml
\```

**Database Schema:**

- **ManualEntry Table:**
  - `id`: Long (Primary Key)
  - `entryType`: String
  - `entryData`: String
  - `entryDate`: ZonedDateTime

### API Endpoints

- **ManualEntry Endpoints:**
  - `POST /manual-entries` - Create a new manual entry.
  - `GET /manual-entries/{id}` - Retrieve manual entry by ID.
  - `PUT /manual-entries/{id}` - Update manual entry details.
  - `DELETE /manual-entries/{id}` - Delete manual entry.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the database and security settings.

2. **Develop Entities and Repositories:**

   - Define JPA entities and repositories for `ManualEntry`.

3. **Implement Services:**

   - Implement business logic in service classes.

4. **Develop Controllers:**

   - Implement REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.

5. **Integration:**

   - Ensure integration with MeasurementService and other relevant services.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Entity Development:** Define entities and repositories.
3. **Service Implementation:** Business logic and services.
4. **Controller Development:** REST endpoints and controllers.
5. **Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
6. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
