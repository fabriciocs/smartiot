# SPEC-004: AlertService

## Background

The AlertService is designed to manage the creation, tracking, and notification of alerts within the Water Resource Management System. It handles various types of alerts, ensuring efficient and timely notifications to users about important events and conditions in the system. The service integrates seamlessly with other system components such as NotificationService.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Alert Management**
   - Create and manage different types of alerts.
   - Provide descriptions and details for each alert.
   - Track the creation date and status of alerts.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle a large number of alerts efficiently.

2. **Security**

   - Ensure data privacy and protection.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

3. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with NotificationService.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud.

**Component Diagram:**
\```plantuml
@startuml
package "AlertService" {
[AlertController] --> [AlertService]
[AlertService] --> [AlertRepository]
[AlertService] --> [NotificationService]
}
@enduml
\```

**Database Schema:**

- **Alert Table:**
  - `id`: Long (Primary Key)
  - `alertType`: String
  - `description`: String
  - `createdDate`: ZonedDateTime

### API Endpoints

- **Alert Endpoints:**
  - `POST /alerts` - Create a new alert.
  - `GET /alerts/{id}` - Retrieve alert by ID.
  - `PUT /alerts/{id}` - Update alert details.
  - `DELETE /alerts/{id}` - Delete alert.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the database and security settings.

2. **Develop Entities and Repositories:**

   - Define JPA entities and repositories for `Alert`.

3. **Implement Services:**

   - Implement business logic in service classes.

4. **Develop Controllers:**

   - Implement REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.

5. **Integration:**

   - Ensure integration with NotificationService.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Entity Development:** Define entities and repositories.
3. **Service Implementation:** Business logic and services.
4. **Controller Development:** REST endpoints and controllers.
5. **Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
6. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
