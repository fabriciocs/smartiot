# SPEC-008: DataAggregationService

## Background

The DataAggregationService is designed to handle the consolidation and aggregation of data from various sources within the Water Resource Management System. This ensures comprehensive and accurate data analysis and reporting, integrating seamlessly with other system components such as ReportingService.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Data Aggregation**
   - Consolidate data from multiple sources.
   - Provide dynamic and configurable data aggregation.
   - Ensure data accuracy and consistency.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle large volumes of data efficiently.

2. **Security**

   - Ensure data privacy and protection.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

3. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with ReportingService and other relevant services.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud.

**Component Diagram:**
\```plantuml
@startuml
package "DataAggregationService" {
[DataAggregationController] --> [DataAggregationService]
[DataAggregationService] --> [DataAggregationRepository]
[DataAggregationService] --> [ReportingService]
}

\```

**Database Schema:**

- **AggregatedData Table:**
  - `id`: Long (Primary Key)
  - `dataType`: String
  - `aggregatedValue`: Double
  - `aggregationDate`: ZonedDateTime

### API Endpoints

- **AggregatedData Endpoints:**
  - `POST /aggregated-data` - Create a new aggregated data entry.
  - `GET /aggregated-data/{id}` - Retrieve aggregated data by ID.
  - `PUT /aggregated-data/{id}` - Update aggregated data details.
  - `DELETE /aggregated-data/{id}` - Delete aggregated data.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the database and security settings.

2. **Develop Entities and Repositories:**

   - Define JPA entities and repositories for `AggregatedData`.

3. **Implement Services:**

   - Implement business logic in service classes.

4. **Develop Controllers:**

   - Implement REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.

5. **Integration:**

   - Ensure integration with ReportingService and other relevant services.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Entity Development:** Define entities and repositories.
3. **Service Implementation:** Business logic and services.
4. **Controller Development:** REST endpoints and controllers.
5. **Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
6. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
