    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The ApiGateway is designed to manage routing, security, and load balancing for the microservices within the Water Resource Management System. It serves as a single entry point for clients, providing centralized authentication and authorization, routing requests to appropriate microservices, and ensuring efficient communication between services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Routing**\n",
    "   - Route incoming requests to appropriate microservices.\n",
    "   - Handle dynamic routing based on service discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Security**\n",
    "   - Implement centralized authentication and authorization using JWT.\n",
    "   - Ensure secure communication between clients and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Balancing**\n",
    "   - Distribute incoming requests evenly across microservice instances.\n",
    "   - Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability**\n",
    "   - Handle a large volume of requests efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration**\n",
    "   - Integrate seamlessly with all microservices.\n",
    "   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.\n",
