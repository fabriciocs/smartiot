# SPEC-006: NotificationService

## Background

The NotificationService is designed to handle the management and delivery of notifications within the Water Resource Management System. It ensures timely and efficient communication of alerts and other important messages to users, integrating seamlessly with other system components such as AlertService.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Notification Management**
   - Create and manage notifications.
   - Deliver notifications via email, SMS, or other channels.
   - Track the status and history of notifications.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle a large volume of notifications efficiently.

2. **Security**

   - Ensure data privacy and protection.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

3. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with AlertService.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud.

**Component Diagram:**
\```plantuml
@startuml
package "NotificationService" {
[NotificationController] --> [NotificationService]
[NotificationService] --> [NotificationRepository]
[NotificationService] --> [AlertService]
}
@enduml
\```

**Database Schema:**

- **Notification Table:**
  - `id`: Long (Primary Key)
  - `notificationType`: String
  - `message`: String
  - `sentDate`: ZonedDateTime

### API Endpoints

- **Notification Endpoints:**
  - `POST /notifications` - Create a new notification.
  - `GET /notifications/{id}` - Retrieve notification by ID.
  - `PUT /notifications/{id}` - Update notification details.
  - `DELETE /notifications/{id}` - Delete notification.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the database and security settings.

2. **Develop Entities and Repositories:**

   - Define JPA entities and repositories for `Notification`.

3. **Implement Services:**

   - Implement business logic in service classes.

4. **Develop Controllers:**

   - Implement REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.

5. **Integration:**

   - Ensure integration with AlertService.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Entity Development:** Define entities and repositories.
3. **Service Implementation:** Business logic and services.
4. **Controller Development:** REST endpoints and controllers.
5. **Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
6. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
