# SPEC-002: EnrollmentService

## Background

The EnrollmentService is designed to handle the enrollment processes within the Water Resource Management System. It manages the lifecycle of consumer enrollments, including registration dates and statuses. The service ensures efficient, scalable, and secure management of enrollment data, integrating seamlessly with other system components such as ConsumerService.

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

1. **Enrollment Management**
   - Register consumer enrollments with complete details.
   - Update and delete enrollment information.
   - Track enrollment statuses and history.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Scalability**

   - Handle a large number of enrollment records efficiently.

2. **Security**

   - Ensure data privacy and protection.
   - Implement JWT-based authentication.

3. **Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with ConsumerService.
   - Ensure robust API design for inter-service communication.

## Method

### Architecture Design

#### Microservice Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JWT for authentication, Gradle for build.

**Frameworks:** Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud.

**Component Diagram:**
\```plantuml
@startuml
package "EnrollmentService" {
[EnrollmentController] --> [EnrollmentService]
[EnrollmentService] --> [EnrollmentRepository]
[EnrollmentService] --> [ConsumerService]
}
@enduml
\```

**Database Schema:**

- **Enrollment Table:**
  - `id`: Long (Primary Key)
  - `registrationDate`: LocalDate
  - `status`: String

### API Endpoints

- **Enrollment Endpoints:**
  - `POST /enrollments` - Create a new enrollment.
  - `GET /enrollments/{id}` - Retrieve enrollment by ID.
  - `PUT /enrollments/{id}` - Update enrollment details.
  - `DELETE /enrollments/{id}` - Delete enrollment.

## Implementation

1. **Setup Project:**

   - Use JHipster to generate the base project structure.
   - Configure the database and security settings.

2. **Develop Entities and Repositories:**

   - Define JPA entities and repositories for `Enrollment`.

3. **Implement Services:**

   - Implement business logic in service classes.

4. **Develop Controllers:**

   - Implement REST controllers for handling HTTP requests.

5. **Integration:**

   - Ensure integration with ConsumerService.

6. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Perform end-to-end testing.

## Milestones

1. **Initial Setup:** Project structure and initial configuration.
2. **Entity Development:** Define entities and repositories.
3. **Service Implementation:** Business logic and services.
4. **Controller Development:** REST endpoints and controllers.
5. **Integration:** Integrate with other microservices.
6. **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the service in the production environment.

## Gathering Results

1. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
2. **Functionality:**

   - Verify all endpoints and business logic meet requirements.

3. **Security:**

   - Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Test the service under load to ensure it scales as expected.
